# Hello UNIX
Notes to self on how to set up a developer space for myself in MacOS.

This is for setting up a fullstack dev environment for NodeJS, Mongo, and MySQL.
Python coming soon!

Applications are deployed to Heroku.


### git
0. Open Terminal
1. Enter the `git` command
2. Prompt will appear to install git
3. If not, refer to [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).
4. Set up your github credentials using:
	`git config --global user.name "Your Name && git config --global user.email "you@example.com"`



### Unhide the /Library Folder
0. Run `chflags nohidden ~/Library/` in Terminal


### ssh
0. Open Terminal
1. Check for any existing SSH keys with `ls -la ~/.ssh`
2. If you get a `No such file or directory` then proceed to step 3, otherwise skip ahead to step 4.
3. Create a new SSH key using `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS TIED TO GITHUB>"`
4. Ensure the SSH agent is enabled using `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`
5. Add your SSH key using `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`
6. Now link the SSH key to github at [https://github.com/settings/keys](https://github.com/settings/keys).
7. In terminal use `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to get your public key
8. Paste that into Github using the link from step 6.


### NodeJS
0. Open Terminal
1. Navigate to [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. Click to download the latest stable (LTS version) of NodeJS
3. After installation, run `node` in Terminal to test if it worked
4. Press `Ctrl C` to exit


### Install Global Node Packages
These are some npm packages I use globally via `sudo npm install -g`

  - chai
  - firebase-tools
  - karma-cli
  - mocha
  - mysql
  - node-debug
  - nodemon
  - sequelize-cli
  - webpack

As an aside, you can view your global packages using `npm list -g --depth 0`


### Homebrew
0. Open Terminal
1. Navigate to [http://brew.sh](http://brew.sh).
2. Copy the command on their website into Terminal and run it
3. Press the Enter key to confirm the download to the default folder
4. Enter the `brew` command after the download to confirm it worked


### Python
Note that Python 2 is usually installed in Mac OS out of the box

0. Open Terminal
1. Check for Python version by typing `python`

If you have Python 2, and want to keep it that way that's cool

0. Note that you may also want to intall the pip package manager for Python 2 using `sudo easy_install pip`
1. You can test if it installed and get the version with `pip -V`

If you want Python 3, then you can install that and pip3 in one shot 

0. Assuming Homebrew is installed, enter `brew install python3` to get Python 3
1. You can test if Python 3 installed and get the version with `python3 -V`
2. You can test if pip installed and get the version with `pip3 -V`


### Anaconda (for data science in Python)
You can also use [Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/) instead of [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). But I picked Anaconda so I can pick either Python 2 or 3.

Note! If you did all the installations I mentioned in this repo, then you will have 3 Python versions on your Mac. One shy of [this guy](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33541876/os-x-deciding-between-anaconda-and-homebrew-python-environments). This shouldn't be an issue but it's good to be aware of it. I plan on using the Mac and Homebrew verisons for web development and the Anaconda version for Data Science.

Anyway, install Anaconda by doing the following:

0. On the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) website choose either the Python 2 or Python 3 version.
1. I picked the Graphical Installer (green button) for Python 3.6.
2. Follow along with the installer's instructions.
3. Type `conda` in your command line to ensure the download was successful.
4. You can look into this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pycon-pandas-tutorial) to mess with the Pandas library in Python.

Note that [Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) should come with Anaconda. If not, use their instructions to download it. Using  `pip` or `pip3` is the easiest download. Type `jupyter` in the command line to see if it was installed.


### MySQL
0. Open Terminal
1. Use Homebrew to install MySQL using `sudo brew install mysql` command in Terminal
2. Run the MySQL server after the installation is complete by entering `mysql.server start` in Terminal
3. Test if the server is working by entering `mysql -u root` 
4. Type `\q` in Terminal to exit the MySQL CLI


### MySQL Workbench
1. Navigate to [http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench)
2. Click to download MySQL Workbench
3. After installation, open the Workbench and click "New Connection" to make a Localhost connection


### MongoDB
0. Open Terminal
1. Use Homebrew to install MongoDB using `sudo brew install mongodb` command in Terminal
2. Configure the MongoDB environment using `sudo mkdir -p /data/db/`
3. Get read/write permission using `sudo chown -R $USER /data/db`
4. Test to see if Mongo is working using `mongod` in Terminal


### RoboMongo
1. Navigate to [https://robomongo.org/download](https://robomongo.org/download)

6. Set up other preferences. In the Menu Bar, click Sublime Text > Preferences > Settings. Then, adjust the following properties:

```
{
  "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Brogrammer/brogrammer.tmTheme",
  "font_size": 10,
  "ignored_packages":
  [
    "Vintage"
